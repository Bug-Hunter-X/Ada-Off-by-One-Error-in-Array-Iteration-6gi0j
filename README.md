# Ada Off-by-One Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Ada when iterating through an array. The code attempts to access an element beyond the valid index range, resulting in a `Constraint_Error` exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful index management when working with arrays in Ada.
